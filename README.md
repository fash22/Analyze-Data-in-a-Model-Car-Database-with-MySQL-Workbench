# Analyze Data in a Model Car Database

# Welcome to my SQL Data Analysis Project!
In this project, I was task to analyze the company database of Mint Classics with the goal of helping them in inventory-related business decision making.

Mint classics is a fictional company retailing classic cars and other vehicles. As of the moment, the company is planning to close one of their storage facilities.

As a data analyst, I was assigned to look deeper into the data model of their business. I was given a MySQL database model containing relevant information about their business. Using this data, they would like to hear some data-backed recommendations for re-organizing or reducing inventory. The overall data model of their company database can be seen below:
